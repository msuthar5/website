  My father has been my motivator and role model. He brought our family to America after many years of continuous struggles and setbacks and his emphasis on education, kindness, and a hard work ethic has been instrumental in his professional and personal development. Throughout my childhood, he has consistently worked 70+ hour weeks and what is amazing is that he has never complained or displayed any disregard for his work. His passion for working to help out others, whether it be in a technical or non-technical sense, has resulted in him becoming an industry leader and well respected in the Informational Technology community. I hope to be a shred of the role model that my dad was for me for my children when the world is blessed with a Manish Jr..

<p class="section-label">WHY DO I CODE?</p>
<p class="large-text-chunk">
  There is a natural euphoria that I feel whenever I theoretically solve a complex problem and successfully implement it with software. Those who practice Hackerrank or Leetcode can relate. I started out at IIT as an ITM (Informational Technology and Management) major, but enjoyed the programming classes the most. As I was ~1.5 semesters graudation, I realized that I wasn't quite satisfied with what I had learned so far and wanted to work as a software engineer and not as a DevOps Engineer or Sys Admin. I had been contemplating switching majors for about a year up to that point and decided to pursue a minor in Software Engineering. I decided to sit into a CS 351 (Systems Programming Lecture) taught by Michael Saelee and was fascinated by the concepts covered. Immediately after leaving the first lecture, I went home and filed a petition to change my major to Computer Science. I knew this would require me to stay at IIT for an additional year but didn't mind it at all. I view this is as the single best decision I have made in my life. As I progressed in my CS curriculum, I started to realize that I can actually use the theory and knowledge acquired through my courses as a tool to enhance civic engagement. A continuous motivator is to create/contribute to a piece of technology that can make someone's life better in any way,shape, or form.
